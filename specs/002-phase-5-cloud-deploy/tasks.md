## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Part A (US1-US6)**: Depends on Phase 2 database schema tasks (T008-T015)
- **Part B (US7-US11, US16)**: Depends on Phase 2 event schemas and Dapr infrastructure (T016-T026)
- **Part C (US12-US15)**: Can start after Part A and Part B are functional
- **Phase 19 (Polish)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### Part A: Advanced Features (US1-US6) - Priority Order

- **US1 (Priority)**: Can start immediately after Foundational - No dependencies
- **US2 (Tags)**: Can start after T010-T011 (Tag models) - No dependency on US1
- **US3 (Due Dates/Reminders)**: Can start after T012 (Reminder model) - No dependency on US1/US2
- **US4 (Recurring)**: Depends on recurring fields in T009 - Event-driven creation needs Part B
- **US5 (Search)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependency on US1-US4
- **US6 (Filter/Sort)**: Can start after US1, US2, US3 provide fields to filter

### Part B: Event-Driven Architecture (US7-US11, US16) - Priority Order

- **US7 (Dapr Pub/Sub)**: MUST complete first - Foundation for all other Part B stories
- **US16 (WebSocket Sync)**: Can start after US7 - Consumes task-updates topic
- **US8 (Notification Service)**: Can start after US7 - Consumes reminders topic
- **US9 (Recurring Task Service)**: Can start after US7 - Consumes task-events topic
- **US10 (Audit Service)**: Can start after US7 - Consumes task-events topic
- **US11 (Dapr Jobs)**: Can start after US7 - Integrates with US3 reminders

### Part C: Cloud Deployment (US12-US15) - Priority Order

- **US12 (CI/CD)**: Can start once services are buildable - Foundation for US13
- **US13 (Cloud K8s)**: Depends on US12 - Needs working CI/CD
- **US14 (Cloud Messaging)**: Depends on US13 - Needs cloud cluster running
- **US15 (Monitoring)**: Depends on US13 - Needs cloud cluster running

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
```
T008 (Priority enum) → T009 (new fields) - sequential
T010, T011, T012, T013 - all [P] can run in parallel
T016, T017, T018 - all [P] can run in parallel
T019, T020, T021, T022 - all [P] can run in parallel
```

**Part A - User Stories can run in parallel**:
```
After T015 (migration), these can start in parallel:
- US1 (T027-T036) - Priority management
- US2 (T037-T048) - Tag management
- US3 (T049-T059) - Due dates & reminders
- US5 (T068-T073) - Search
```

**Part B - Consumer services can run in parallel**:
```
After US7 (T082-T089), these can start in parallel:
- US8 (T090-T096) - Notification Service
- US9 (T097-T104) - Recurring Task Service
- US10 (T105-T113) - Audit Service
- US16 (T120-T133) - WebSocket Service
```

## Parallel Example: Part B Microservices

```bash
# After US7 (Dapr Pub/Sub) is complete, launch all consumer services in parallel:
Task: "Create Notification Service project structure in services/notification-service/"
Task: "Create Recurring Task Service project structure in services/recurring-task-service/"
Task: "Create Audit Service project structure in services/audit-service/"
Task: "Create WebSocket Service project structure in services/websocket-service/"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Part A Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (database schema only - T008-T015)
3. Complete US1 (Priority) → Test independently
4. Complete US2 (Tags) → Test independently
5. Complete US3 (Due Dates) → Test independently
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: All advanced features working
7. Deploy to Vercel (existing Phase 2 setup) for demo

### Full Implementation

1. **Week 1**: Setup + Foundational + Part A (US1-US6)
2. **Week 2**: Part B (US7-US11, US16) - Event-driven architecture
3. **Week 3**: Part C (US12-US15) - Cloud deployment
4. **Week 4**: Polish, testing, documentation

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

**Team A (Backend Focus)**:
- Phase 2: Database schema (T008-T015)
- Part A: US1, US2, US3 backend tasks
- Part B: US7, US11 (Dapr Pub/Sub, Jobs API)

**Team B (Services Focus)**:
- Part B: US8, US9, US10, US16 (all consumer microservices)

**Team C (Frontend + DevOps)**:
- Part A: Frontend tasks (T032-T081)
- Part C: CI/CD, Cloud deployment (US12-US15)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies
